## Mule Audio Library

A bunch of tools for making and playing audio.

Uses the [portaudo-rs library](https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-portaudio) for playback.

Tools for creating, chaining, and mixing audio based on shape (sine, sawtooth, square), amplitude, frequency, and changing values over time.

See [dsp-chain](https://github.com/RustAudio/dsp-chain) (also from RustAudio; those guys are great) for a better set of tools if you actually want to do this sort of thing for real.
